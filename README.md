# Hello extension

![Hello-extension-logo](images/500.png)

Simple chrome extension template, that you can customize to have a good welcome when you open the browser

## Steps to get ready

Go to:

- `/images` and add 8 files: `0-6.jpeg` + `cursor.png` (if you use different file format make sure to change it later in style.css _line 33_ and script.js _line 26_)
- `/page/style.css` where you can change colors as you wish on _lines 3,4,5_
- `/page/script.js` and add 7 strings to _greetingsList_ one for every day of the week
